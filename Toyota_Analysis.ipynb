    "Overfitting and Zero Error in Training Data\n",
    "Because of the phenomenon of overfitting, a model fitted to training data may not always produce zero errors. \n",
    "When a model learns the noise and random fluctuations in addition to the underlying patterns in the training data, this is known as overfitting. As a result, the model performs terribly on fresh, untested data but remarkably well on the training set. \n",
    "1.Overfitting Definition: An overfit model is one that identifies outliers and noise in the training data rather than focusing just on the broad trends. As a result, the model becomes overly intricate and tuned in too much to the training set.\n",
    "2.Zero Error Concern: A model is likely too sophisticated and has learned the training data if it achieves zero error on the training set. Although this would appear ideal, it usually means that the model has not generalized very successfully.\n",
    "3.Generalization: Applying the lessons learned from the training data to fresh data from the same distribution is the main objective of a prediction model. Overfitting a model will result in low bias but large variance, which will make it underperform on test data and in practical applications.\n",
    "4.Bias-Variance Tradeoff: The bias-variance tradeoff and overfitting are connected. On unseen data, a highly complex model (with little bias) will perform poorly due to its huge variance. On the other hand, a more straightforward model may have greater bias but less variance, which frequently leads to better generalization.\n",
    "5.Validation and Regularization: Methods like cross-validation and regularization are applied to avoid overfitting. Using cross-validation, you may make sure the model works well on various subsets by dividing the data into distinct sets. Excessively complex models are penalized by regularization approaches like L1 and L2 regularization.    \n",

    "# Model Selection Based on Training and Validation Accuracy\n",
    "It is crucial to take into account the models performance on the validation data in addition to the training data when selecting which model to use. \n",

    "2.Generalization: A machine learning models ability to generalize successfully to new data is its main objective. The validation data is a better predictor of the model's performance in real-world circumstances because it acts as a surrogate for data that has not yet been seen.\n",
